## Core messanging

Claim: Open Source Desktop Alternative to OpenAI GPTs

### Run Code Locally
Run it locally; the console can perform all the tasks that your machine is capable of executing.

### Improves with Use
Describe in plain text how to perform a given task once, and thereafter AIConsole will know how to execute it indefinitely.

### Utilize Your Notes for AI Training
Employ your notes to instruct the AI in completing and automating tasks.

### Better than Vector Databases
For each step of your tasks, leverage a precise, efficient, and automated multi-agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that is on par with expert prompt engineering.

### Completely Open Sourced
This software does not transmit any data to any parties other than the LLM APIs – and you can confirm this for yourself.

### Share Your Tools with the Community
Develop and share your domain-specific AI tools, for instance, on platforms like GitHub or Discord.

## Era of Hyper-Personalisation

I think that not many people talk about one good thing that comes with AI, there are many talks that it will take our jobs, or that it's a treat to humanity.

I belive that AI will actually do the opposity and put the power into the hands of the people.

We are leaving the software area in which big monolith winner takes all startups like Uber or Facebook dominate.

We are entering the area of hyper-personalisation and end user empowerment, which will be all about the power of the individual.

In essence everyone will be running their own LLMs on their own needs and their own data, those AIs will engage with digital world for you.

At 10Clouds AI Labs we have built a tool around those principles, an open source tool called AIConsole.

What AIConsole is?
* A ChatGPT like chatbot, but with multi agent support and ability to craft and store your own pieces of context.
* A desktop application that you can run locally, console can do all the things that you can on your machine.
* An editor that allows you to build and share your domain specfic AI tools (for example on github)
* Describe in plain text how to perform a given task once and then AIConsole knows how to do it forever.
* AIConsole is not based on vector databsase, it maximizes output from AI for each step of your tasks: A precise, efficient and automatic multi-agent RAG system on par with expert prompt engineering.
* With AIConsole you can use plain English to build local, personalized AI tools that will get the job done.

## How does it work in practice?

Let's say I want to be able to send messages to my girlfriend using AI:

1. Install it using instructions provided here: from github.com/10clouds/aiconsole
2. Creatte a new project directory, for example personal-aiconsole
3. Run aiconsole in that directory
4. Try "Send an imessage to my girlfriend with a my calendar for Today".
5. AIConsole will try to figure out how to do it and most likely fail, due to the fact that it does not know key things: Who is your girlfriends, where is your calendar, how to access it, how to send an imessage.
6. Let's teach it those
7. First create a "Social Circle" material in AIConsole and put there information about who is your girlfriend, if you are on a mac, AIConsole will know how to access your contacts app based on the name provided, but you can also supply full contact information here.
8. Create a "Calendar Manual" material in AIConsole and put there information on where it is located, is it a google calendar local calendar. This will require experimentation as if you will be using local apps you will most likely do not need credentials, and when querying google calendar you will need to provide them along with maybe examples of code that work for it.
We are currently working on creating a library of materials for common tools, and we want to work with community to build and share those materials.
9. We already have build in imessage manual.
10. Now try to re run the command, it should work. If it stumbles for any reason, reedit the materials, give additional information or instructions and try again.

This way you can teach your AIConsole to do anything for you, you can also provide information about who you are, what you care about, your company services etc so for example it can write blog posts for you or respond in your name, you can provide access to various tools of yours etc.

Looks good but first figure out how to structure those ideas into a blog post because maybe some of those should be put in seperate conceptual "buckets", also  besides the philosophical points include in the final blogpost more concrete information on what the current AIConsole provides:

User can create projects for various domains, a book that they are writing, their personal and professional life, a RPG session that they are conducting or central information for accessing their startup data.

In a project a user can create materials: both textual and small snippets of code that helps AIConsole in executing tasks.  They can also create agents which specialise in given tasks, like writing content. executing code or giving emotional support.

The system will select the agents and materials needed for a given step of what the user needs.

The user can use this in a similar way they would use ChatGPT but storing in it private data, manipulate their browser, manipulate and extract data from their local files, access apis. While right now it's designed for AI power user, with time it will become more and more accessible as we develop additional features.

Everyone can get it from https://aiconsole.ai


## More info:
* AIConsole can be used as a personal assistant in your various projects.
* AIConsole allows you to build your own AI-Powered, domain specific, multi-agent personal assistant
* AIConsole offers you the ability to add or edit agents and materials. The more you spend time on it, the better it gets.
* AIConsole can be run locally on a user machine
* It can be used to build domain tools
* AI Agents in AIConsole are built in a way that it conserves AI thinking power (context/tokens) so when it executes a complex task it can only use the information (materials and agent speciality) that is needed for that specific subtask.
* AIConsole has a web interface which makes it easy to operate
* AIConsole can execute any task that is doable in python as it generates code and runs it on the fly, this makes it super easy for it to perform tasks like getting your calendar info or sending emails.
* AIConsole does not need you to know coding in order to do that, it executes that code under the hood (but you can still view it).
* AIConsole has multiple agents, all of them having different chracteristics (system prompt) and mode of operation (normal or code execution).
* AIConsole agents will be able to talk to each other and invoke each other (pending, not yet done)
* You can edit and add your own agents, they are in ./agents directory in the directory you run the aiconsole in
* You can provide materials to the agents, those are pieces of information that the agents will select and use during their work, those are (but not limited to): general information about yourself, infromation on how to 
erform a given task like writing a linkedin post, information how to access a given API, information about service offering of your company etc.
* As you add materials and agents this tool grows with power with time. So the more time you spend on it the better it gets. If it does not know how to do a given task you can teach it.
* When you update your installation of aiconsole, make sure to start a fresh project or delete ./materials and ./agents directories in order to get new versions of them with updated materials and agents.
* When you edit a material, it immediatelly gets reloaded and is available in your current conversation
* Create .md files in ./materials directory in the following format:
```md
<!---
Description of when this material should be used?
-->

# Title of the material

Actual content of a material
```

Files are monitored and automatically loaded, then used as context. You can keep there API materials, login information, prompts and other contextual information.

You can see examples of materials i ./materials directory

* You can go back to previous commands using up arrow
* All chats histories are saved in ./.aic/history
* AIConsole is open source, link to repo: https://github.com/10clouds/aiconsole
* 10Clouds (10clouds.com) is developing custom integrations for it, if you need one feel free to contact us.
* Each directory you run it in is your new project directory
* How to run aiconsole:

```shell
pip install --upgrade aiconsole --pre
cd your_project_dir
export OPENAI_API_KEY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
aiconsole
```

aiconsole will create a bunch of working files like standard materials and agents

* You have full control how you use the context window of GPT-4, you can delete and edit past messages
* Uses OpenAI GPT-4 internally for all operations, but will be expanded with ability to use open source models. It accesses it through an API.

* Examples of what you can do with AIConsole:
1. Assuming you have description of your company services among your materials, a second material containing top clients and a module to access company org structure (or a text material containing it) - write an email containing a poem about usage of my company services for our top clients and send it to our CTO
2. Write a linkedin post by myself (works really well if you provide it with materials on how to write good linkedin posts, and who are you and what is important to you when talkint with the world)
3. Reject all of my calendar events for tomorrow (assuming you have a material contaning information on how to access your calendar by an API and what are your credentials)
